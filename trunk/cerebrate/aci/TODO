* Handle blocked motors

calibrate wheelbase

Localization should either also happen during standstill, or the
localization timeout should take into account periods of
standstill. The former can be done by sometimes accepting to correct
only (x,y), i.e. when the anchor is too far away (or invalid) for
determining theta.

Implement "release motors" button for manually unblocking the robot.

Bug in behavior, sometimes does not set goal to target!
